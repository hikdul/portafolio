# 🧑‍💻 My Personal Portfolio || hikdul

This is my personal web portfolio, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), where I showcase some of my projects, skills, and contact information.

> The purpose of this project is to share my work and style as a frontend developer, even though my real strength lies in backend development.

- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React 18](https://reactjs.org/)
